									<h3>Yes let's talk about Apex Legends and why I love this game!</h3>
                                        
                                    <p>As of recently, this game has become one of my (if not the only) favorite games to play. Apex Legends is a free-to-play, first-person Battle Royale game released in February 2019. The game was created by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts.</p>

                                    <p>Apex Legends takes place in a post-apocalyptic setting where the battlefield is surrounded by a force field called The Ring… Like every other Battle Royale game.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>My history with the game was the love-hate kind before I started to pay attention to it. I used to play Call of Duty: Warzone during Covid-Times, but since that Warzone had been in such a state of disarray, I gave Apex a shot. Once I got used to it and really gave it some time, it quickly grew on me. I’ve now been playing this game full-time whenever I get the chance of course, but everything else is just noise. I’ve not only met some cool people during my time playing, but we’ve also actually grown to develop chemistry with one another rather quickly.</p>
                                        
                                    <p>The game has such a unique feel to it, there aren’t many “realistic” aspects to it, such as the weaponry, and animals associated with it, but there is a large focus on play-style. You get to deploy with two other people in your squad (3 total), and you face off against 20 other 3-person teams - the last one standing wins. Before deploying, you get to choose which “legend” you want to play with, who reach have unique abilities. The list of legends had grown fairly extensive over time, you can find them shown below. People usually stick to one legend and call them “mains.” I’m not a huge fan of having a main legend to play with, I think it takes the fun out of the game.</p>

                                    <img class = "apexpic" src="/images/apex-legends.jpg" alt="apex-legends-pic"
                                    width = "1000"
                                    height = "600" />

                                    <h4>Legends/Squad</h4>

                                    <p>Each legend has three abilities, passive, tactical, and an ultimate. Passive is the one that works all the time, tactical can be used once in a while and has a fairly quick cool-down time, and the ultimate is the one that gives the legend their unique ability. When I started playing, I used to play a LOT with Bloodhound, who is a recon legend, and a hunter - their passive is “Tracker,” where they can see footprints, battle prints, etc. while running around. Their tactical is called “Eye of the Allfather,” a scan of up to 75 meters that can briefly reveal the spot of enemies. And finally their ultimate is called “Beast of the Hunt” where they become faster in speed and highlight enemies and the enemy’s footprints. All giving them an “ultimate” ability to hunt.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Nowadays I’ve been playing quite a bit with Seer - who is also a recon legend, and is informally called the “better version of Bloodhound.” His passive is a “Heart Seeker” where he can detect the heartbeats of enemies up to 75 meters, whether they’re in front of him, or behind a barrier. Seer’s tactical is called “Focus of Attention,” where he can create a small 75-meter-long path that will highlight enemies and show their health above their head; this follows the enemy for a few seconds giving us the benefit. His ultimate is called “Exhibit” a 65-meter dome made of all of his micro-drones, allowing him to see quick-moving enemies and firing, regardless of where they are in that dome.</p>

                                    <p>I will also play with other legends like Octane, who is a lot of fun due to his speed. Fuse, who is pretty funny to listen to with his quips, Vantage, and the newly added legend, Catalyst. All these guys give a different style of play, every time I play with them… Which is how Apex Legends keeps me coming back to play!</p>

                                    <h4>Heirlooms</h4>

                                    <p>I think that one of the coolest things within the game and its history is the Heirlooms. These things are rare to get if you’ve just gotten into playing the game. Almost every legend has an heirloom, which is a cosmetic skin for their melee weapon, very specific to them and their lure (which I will get into in a bit). First of all, they look SUPER sweet! Second, as mentioned before, they’re extremely rare unless you’re part of the Collection Event or, from what I understand, open up 500 Apex sets - and that’s less than a 1% chance to receive Heirloom Shards. Anyways, my favorite ones are Bloodhound’s Raven's Bite axe, Wraith’s Kunai blade, and Octane’s Butterfly Knife. I’m looking forward to this season when Seer’s Collection Event comes to pass… I shamelessly say that I will probably be spending some money to obtain it.</p>

                                    <table class = "table-wrapper">
                                        <td><img class = "apexHeirloom" src="/images/apex-ravens-bite.png" alt="Bloodhound’s Raven Bite"></td>
                                        <td><img class = "apexHeirloom" src="/images/apex-kunai.png" alt="Wraith's Kunai Blade"></td>
                                        <td><img class = "apexHerloom" src="/images/apex-butterfly-knife.png" alt="Octane's Butterfly Knife"></td>
                                    </table>

                                    <p>Honorable mentions for the Heirlooms are Bangalore’s Cold Steel dagger, Revenant’s Dead Man’s Curve, Caustic’s Death Hammer, and of course Mirage’s Too Much Witt. Cool to have, but personally, since I don’t really play with any of these guys, I can’t justify spending my hard-earned Heirloom Shards on them.</p>

                                    <h4>Uhm.. Also.... These heirlooms also exist in real life... So if anyone wants to buy me a little gift - you know what I would like :)</h4>

                                    <h4>Lure</h4>

                                    <p>The Lure… This I think is the best thing about Apex Legends! I’m a huge fan of the fantasy genre when it comes to anything… Movies, books, all the above! How does this tie into Apex Legends, you ask? Allow me to tell you!</p>

                                    <p>I’ve spent a weird amount of time looking up the history of each character. Some quips are mentioned throughout the game that hint at each legend's life before the Games, and this not only sparks my curiosity but also gives me a feeling that this game is deeper than what you see on the screen. Each character has a fascinating story for the player to figure out (if he/she is that type of person), but I couldn’t wait and I just YouTube’d it, as other people have done the hunting behind the scenes.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Each legend has an ethnicity, and often has quips in that language - I didn’t realize this until Rampart (an Indian legend), said “Chal Dhoom machate hain…… It’s party time!” my ears perked up and my instant response was “HEY I KNOW WHAT SHE JUST SAID!” My squamates said “yeah dude… she just said it’s party time,” to which I replied, “no the part before that!” - clearly no one else was impressed. That night after the games, it started to mess with my head, and the dots started connecting. I paid closer attention to what everyone was saying, and I started getting more and more intrigued.</p>

                                    <p>I love fantasy and so I thought about Bloodhound being involved in Norse Mythology, looked up their history, and how they became what they are. Likewise for Octane and his Hispanic heritage, along with Seer and his Nigerian heritage. Another pretty cool thing is that a lot of the legends in the game know each other from either conflict, friendship or they are family members. This becomes quite apparent when the quips pop up to thank someone, say you’re welcome, res them, or something similar. Very nice easter eggs throughout the game, for more games to come.</p>

                                    <p>I’d like to touch on Seer for a quick second, his real name is Obi Edolasim and he speaks Igbo, throughout my time playing him as my legend, I kept hearing him say “Dalo,” and obviously I got curious, so one game after I died, I Google’d what “dalo” meant, it means THANK YOU!… Obviously. But this game has opened me up to speaking bits and pieces of different languages! So now I say dalo to my Wife and Kids every now and then.</p>

                                    <p>Well, that’s enough about the game and my fascination with it. Hope you enjoyed it! And if you haven't played it yet, I highly recommend doing so soon! See you on the battlefield!</p>

                                    <p>Always with love,</p>
                                    <p>Sully</p>
